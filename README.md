## Description

Minimal React app built for Urban Biofilter's Adapt Oakland project. The aim is to present several years of urban design/environmental research through an interactive map that integrates with a varierty of charts, tables, case studies, and other information.

This data is grouped into many overlapping categories, so a system of 'tagging' is being used to arbitrarily relate the data. These tags are activated and deactivated by the UI menus to selectively query the content shown. 

Boilerplate from: [https://github.com/Hyra/Frickle/](https://github.com/Hyra/Frickle/).


## API
The REST API routes are auto-generated by mers: https://github.com/jspears/mers

- To seed the database, run node seed_db
- Check out the '/seeds' folder for sample data, or use Postman to explore the API.
- Mers has support for filtering resources. 
- The following resources are supported:
  - asset
  - map
  - mapstyle
  - tabular
  - tag
  - text
  - user
- Try out the following on the sample data for an example of how multiple tags in the UI state could be concatenated to change the output of queries. NOTE: It seems that MERS only supports filtering on strings. Only 1 filter works.
  - http://localhost:8080/api/text
  - http://localhost:8080/api/text?filter[tags]=one_tag
